# Volume

Designed a very basic HTML web page with both form tags and a JavaScript code that will allow the user to calculate the Volume for a cylinder, sphere or cone and output the results in either English or SI units. The web page contains:

(1) Allow the user to select either English or SI units with the use of a radio button selection.
(2) Allow the user to select the shape with a pull down menu.
(3) Allow the user to enter the radius and height values in separate text box.
(4) Once the data is collected have a button tag that will activate a javascript that will read the form data and return the input data. The units and shape selection should be displayed as shown below. (Your display should be dynamic depending on the selections.)
(5) The shape, radius and height data displays in a table.
(6) The script calculate the volume based on the input data and display these results in the table.
